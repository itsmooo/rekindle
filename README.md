Employees Burnout Analysis and Prediction
=========================================

This project aims to analyze and predict employee burnout based on various attributes, such as designation, work-from-home availability, and other relevant factors. The goal is to provide insights into potential burnout risks and help organizations take preventive measures.

Project Structure
-----------------

The project is organized as follows:

*   **Data:** Contains raw and processed data used in the project.
    
*   **Notebooks:** Contains Jupyter notebooks with code for data exploration, model building, and evaluation.
    
*   **Models:** Houses a collection of trained machine learning models.
    
*   **Reports:** Includes project reports such as a Power BI data analysis report and a presentation.
    
*   **Images:** Contains all relevant images used for documentation, presentations, and visual aids.
    
*   **Static:** Contains static files, including images and stylesheets.
    
*   **Templates:** Contains HTML templates used for rendering web pages.
    
*   **app.py:** The main file that runs the web application.
    
*   **Requirements:** A text file listing the required dependencies to run the project.
    

Project Description
-------------------

This project uses machine learning models to analyze and predict employee burnout based on several features. The dataset includes attributes such as:

*   Employee designation
    
*   Work-from-home availability
    
*   Workload
    
*   Stress factors
    
*   Demographics, etc.
    

By analyzing this data, the goal is to identify the risk of burnout and suggest ways to mitigate it.

Model Overview
--------------

Machine learning algorithms are applied to predict burnout. The project includes a series of steps like data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The trained models are then saved for future use.

Reports
-------

The reports folder contains analysis and presentation files for sharing insights and findings, including:

*   **Power BI Report:** A detailed data analysis.
    
*   **Presentation:** A slide deck summarizing the project and its findings.
    

Web Application
---------------

The web application is designed to allow users to input employee data and get predictions about burnout risk. The app is built using Python's Flask framework and uses the trained machine learning models to make real-time predictions.

Requirements
------------

To run this project, you need the following libraries:

*   pandas
    
*   numpy
    
*   scikit-learn
    
*   flask
    
*   matplotlib
    
*   seaborn
    
*   Power BI (for report generation)
    
*   etc. (All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt)
